# Manager Agent

The Manager agent serves as the entry point for all user interactions in Open SWE. It classifies incoming messages and routes them to the appropriate workflow.

## Role

- **Primary orchestrator** that receives all user requests
- **Message classifier** that determines the intent and appropriate action
- **Session manager** that maintains conversation context

## How It's Invoked

The Manager agent is automatically invoked when:

- A new GitHub issue is created with the Open SWE label
- A user sends a message through the web interface
- A follow-up message is received in an existing conversation

## Workflow Steps

The Manager agent follows these key nodes:

1. **`initialize-github-issue`** - Fetches GitHub issue details if applicable
2. **`classify-message`** - Analyzes the message to determine routing:
   - Route to Planner for new coding tasks
   - Create new session for general queries
   - End conversation for completion messages
3. **`create-new-session`** - Initializes a new conversation thread
4. **`start-planner`** - Launches the Planner agent for coding tasks

## Key Characteristics

- **No tool calling** - The Manager focuses purely on orchestration
- **Stateless classification** - Each message is evaluated independently
- **Thread management** - Maintains session continuity across agents

The Manager agent ensures requests are properly routed while maintaining a clean separation between conversation management and task execution.
