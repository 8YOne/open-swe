# Programmer Agent

The Programmer agent executes task plans by making code changes, running tests, and managing the development workflow.

## Role

- **Task executor** that implements code changes according to the plan
- **Code editor** that modifies files and creates new implementations
- **Workflow manager** that handles testing, reviews, and pull requests

## How It's Invoked

The Programmer agent is invoked by:
- The Planner agent after a task plan is accepted
- Direct thread creation when resuming an existing task

## Workflow Steps

Key nodes in the Programmer workflow:

1. **`initialize`** - Sets up the sandbox environment
2. **`generate-action`** - Main tool-calling node for code changes
3. **`take-action`** - Executes tool calls and processes results
4. **`update-plan`** - Modifies the task plan if needed
5. **`handle-completed-task`** - Processes task completion
6. **`summarize-history`** - Condenses conversation for context
7. **`route-to-review-or-conclusion`** - Decides between review or completion
8. **`reviewer-subgraph`** - Invokes code review process
9. **`generate-conclusion`** - Summarizes all changes made
10. **`open-pr`** - Creates the final pull request

## Available Tools

During the `generate-action` node, the Programmer has access to:

- **`grep`** - Search for code patterns
- **`shell`** - Run commands, tests, and builds
- **`str_replace_based_edit_tool`** (Anthropic) / **`apply_patch`** (others) - Edit files
- **`request_human_help`** - Ask for clarification when stuck
- **`update_plan`** - Modify the task plan
- **`get_url_content`** - Fetch documentation
- **`install_dependencies`** - Install project dependencies
- **`mark_task_completed`** - Mark current task as done
- **`search_document_for`** - Search within documents
- **MCP tools** - Any configured Model Context Protocol tools

## Key Characteristics

- **Iterative execution** - Works through tasks one at a time
- **Self-correction** - Can diagnose and fix errors
- **Review integration** - Automatically triggers code review before PR
- **Progress tracking** - Maintains task completion status

The Programmer agent handles the actual implementation work, ensuring code changes are properly tested and reviewed before creating pull requests.
