# Programmer Agent

The Programmer agent executes approved implementation plans by making code changes, running tests, and handling all aspects of the development process.

## Role & Responsibilities

### Code Implementation
- Executes approved plans through systematic code changes
- Applies patches, edits files, and manages dependencies
- Runs tests and validates implementations

### Task Management
- Tracks plan progress and marks tasks as completed
- Handles plan updates and modifications during implementation
- Manages the overall execution workflow

## Invocation

The Programmer is invoked by the Planner agent via `startProgrammerRun()` after:
- Plan approval (manual or automatic)
- Plan acceptance through human interrupt

## Available Tools

During the `generate-action` node, the Programmer has access to:

- **`apply-patch`** - Apply code patches and diffs
- **`shell`** - Execute commands, run tests, build projects
- **`grep`** - Search codebase for patterns and references
- **`text-editor`** - Create, edit, and modify files
- **`install-dependencies`** - Install required packages and dependencies
- **`get-url-content`** - Fetch external resources and documentation
- **`search-document-for`** - Search within fetched documents
- **`MCP tools`** - Additional tools via Model Context Protocol
- **`request-human-help`** - Request assistance when stuck
- **`update-plan`** - Modify the current plan if needed
- **`mark-task-completed`** - Mark individual tasks as finished

## Key Nodes

- **`initialize`** - Set up sandbox and execution environment
- **`generate-action`** - Determine next implementation step
- **`take-action`** - Execute the chosen action using tools
- **`update-plan`** - Handle plan modifications
- **`handle-completed-task`** - Process completed tasks
- **`generate-conclusion`** - Finalize implementation
- **`open-pr`** - Create pull request automatically

## Code Review Integration

Before concluding, the Programmer invokes the **Reviewer subgraph** to:
- Review all code changes
- Provide feedback and suggestions
- Ensure quality and correctness
- Loop back for improvements if needed

## Completion Process

1. **Implementation** - Execute plan tasks systematically
2. **Review** - Invoke Reviewer subgraph for code review
3. **Refinement** - Address reviewer feedback if needed
4. **Conclusion** - Generate final summary
5. **PR Creation** - Automatically create pull request

The Programmer ensures thorough implementation while maintaining code quality through integrated review processes.
