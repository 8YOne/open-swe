# Agents Overview

Open SWE uses a four-agent system to handle software engineering tasks from initial request to final implementation. Each agent has a specific role in the workflow, working together to understand requirements, generate plans, implement code changes, and ensure quality.

## Agent Architecture

The system consists of four specialized agents:

### **Manager Agent**
The entry point and coordinator that routes user requests to appropriate agents and manages session state.

### **Planner Agent** 
Generates comprehensive implementation plans by analyzing codebases and gathering context about user requirements.

### **Programmer Agent**
Executes approved plans by making code changes, running tests, and handling implementation details.

### **Reviewer Agent**
Reviews code changes and provides feedback to ensure quality and correctness before completion.

## Workflow

The agents work together in a coordinated flow:

1. **Manager** receives and classifies user requests
2. **Planner** generates detailed implementation plans
3. **Programmer** implements the approved plan
4. **Reviewer** reviews changes and provides feedback
5. **Programmer** addresses feedback and creates pull requests

This architecture ensures that complex software engineering tasks are broken down systematically, implemented carefully, and reviewed thoroughly before completion.
