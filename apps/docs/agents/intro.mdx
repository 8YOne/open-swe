# Agent Architecture

Open SWE uses a multi-agent system built with LangGraph to handle complex software engineering tasks. Each agent has a specific role and set of capabilities designed to work together seamlessly.

## Agent Overview

  <Card title="Programmer" icon="code" href="/agents/programmer">
    Executes task plans by making code changes and managing the development workflow

## How Agents Work Together

1. **Manager** receives and classifies user requests
2. **Planner** analyzes the request and creates an execution plan
3. **Programmer** implements the plan through code changes
4. **Reviewer** validates changes before creating a pull request

Each agent is implemented as a LangGraph StateGraph with specific nodes for different operations and decision points. The agents communicate through shared state and thread management, enabling complex workflows while maintaining clear separation of concerns.
