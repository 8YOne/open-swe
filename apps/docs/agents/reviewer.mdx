# Reviewer Agent

The Reviewer agent performs code review to ensure quality and correctness before pull request creation.

## Role

- **Code reviewer** that analyzes changes for quality and correctness
- **Quality gatekeeper** that ensures changes meet standards
- **Feedback provider** that can request additional changes

## How It's Invoked

The Reviewer agent is invoked:
- As a subgraph within the Programmer agent
- After all tasks are completed but before PR creation
- Can be invoked multiple times based on review feedback

## Workflow Steps

Key nodes in the Reviewer workflow:

1. **`initialize-state`** - Sets up review context and environment
2. **`generate-review-actions`** - Main tool-calling node for review analysis
3. **`take-review-actions`** - Executes review tool calls
4. **`diagnose-reviewer-error`** - Handles any errors during review
5. **`final-review`** - Makes final determination on code quality

## Available Tools

During the `generate-review-actions` node, the Reviewer has access to:

- **`grep`** - Search for patterns and potential issues
- **`shell`** - Run tests, linters, and type checkers
- **`view`** - Examine changed files and their context
- **`install_dependencies`** - Install dependencies if needed for testing
- **`scratchpad`** - Take notes during review process

## Key Characteristics

- **Focused scope** - Reviews only the changes made by the Programmer
- **Automated testing** - Runs relevant tests and checks
- **Iterative process** - Can request changes and re-review
- **Binary outcome** - Either approves for PR or requests improvements

The Reviewer agent acts as an automated code review process, catching issues before they reach human reviewers and ensuring consistent quality standards.
