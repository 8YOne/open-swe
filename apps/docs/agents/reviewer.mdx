# Reviewer Agent

The Reviewer agent operates as a subgraph within the Programmer agent, providing code review and feedback to ensure quality and correctness before implementation completion.

## Role & Responsibilities

### Code Review
- Reviews all code changes made during implementation
- Analyzes changes for correctness, quality, and adherence to standards
- Provides specific feedback and improvement suggestions

### Quality Assurance
- Validates that implementations meet requirements
- Checks for potential issues, bugs, or improvements
- Ensures code follows project patterns and conventions

## Invocation

The Reviewer is invoked as an **embedded subgraph** within the Programmer agent:
- Automatically triggered before the Programmer concludes
- Runs after implementation tasks are completed
- Operates within the same execution context as the Programmer

## Available Tools

During the `generate-review-actions` node, the Reviewer has access to:

- **`grep`** - Search codebase for patterns and references
- **`shell`** - Execute commands, run tests, check builds
- **`install-dependencies`** - Install packages needed for testing
- **`scratchpad`** - Take notes during review process
- **`view`** - Read and examine file contents

## Key Nodes

- **`initialize-state`** - Set up review context and state
- **`generate-review-actions`** - Determine review actions to take
- **`take-review-actions`** - Execute review tools and analysis
- **`final-review`** - Generate final review feedback

## Feedback Loop Mechanism

### Review Process
1. **Initialize** - Set up review context with code changes
2. **Analysis** - Use tools to examine changes and run tests
3. **Feedback** - Generate specific review comments and suggestions
4. **Decision** - Determine if changes are acceptable or need revision

### Iteration Limits
- **`maxReviewCount`** - Default limit of 3 review iterations
- Prevents infinite feedback loops
- Ensures timely completion while maintaining quality

### Loop Back to Programmer
If the review identifies issues:
- Feedback is provided to the Programmer
- Programmer addresses the feedback
- Process repeats until approval or iteration limit

## Integration with Programmer

The Reviewer operates seamlessly within the Programmer workflow:
- No separate session management required
- Shares context and state with Programmer
- Provides feedback that directly influences next actions
- Ensures quality gates before PR creation

The Reviewer ensures that all implementations meet quality standards while maintaining efficient development workflows.
